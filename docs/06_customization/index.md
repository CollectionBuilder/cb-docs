# Customize and Configure 

**Each of these "config-" files is a CSV (comma-separated-values) file that is stored in the `/_data/` directory of your repository.** 
They will configure what pages are displayed in the navigation menu and what metadata is featured on various pages.

We recommend that you edit them using your text editor, but Google Sheets or another spreadsheet program (that supports UTF-8 encoding) will also work. 
If you're using VS Code, adding the [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) plugin is helpful for reading CSVs in plain text format.

Refer to the [Theme File section](../05_theme/) for more information about customizing the various pages in your collection.
