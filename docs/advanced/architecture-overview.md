# Overview of CollectionBuilder Template Directory Structure and Conventions

CollectionBuilder is a Jekyll-based project, so most of the folder structure and architecture follows the basic [directory structure of Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/).
This section provides a high-level overview of files and folders as they are used in CollectionBuilder.

| Directory | Description|
| --- | --- |
| `_data/` | The [Jekyll data](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) folder contains CSVs and YAML that can be accessed by the template to build the site. In CB "_data/" will contain your metadata CSV, the "config-" CSVs that set options for visualization pages, and "theme.yml" that sets some overall configurations. |
| `_includes/` | The [Jekyll includes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) folder contains modular chunks of HTML and JS that are used by pages and layouts to generate content on the site. |
| `_layouts/` | The [Jekyll layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/) folder contains HTML templates used to build all the pages on the site. CB users may want to tweak some layouts, such as ["home-infographic.html"]({{ '/docs/pages/home/' | relative_url }}), to control how pages look. In CB-CSV the folder "_layouts/item/" contains the layouts that match the `display_template` used by collection items. |
| `_plugins/` | The [Jekyll plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) folder contains extensions to Jekyll written in Ruby. CB-CSV and CB-CONTENTdm come with [custom CB plugins](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv/blob/main/docs/plugins.md) that are required to build item pages and efficiently process metadata. |
| `_sass/` | Contains "Sass partials", modular chunks of [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) CSS. These partials are pulled into the file "assets/css/custom.scss", adding CB specific styles. Users can add custom CSS that will override all Bootstrap and CB styles by editing the "_custom.scss" file. |
| `_site/` | Contains the full static site output by Jekyll. This folder is ignored by Git, since it should not be committed to your project. After doing a `rake deploy` or `jekyll build`, the contents "_site" can be copied to a web hosting location. This is done automatically by [online deployment services]({{ '/docs/deploy/' | relative_url }}) such as GitHub Pages, Actions, or Render. |
| `assets/` | Contains third-party libraries, as well as CB CSS, JS, and data used on the site. The contents of this folder do not generally need to be edited by CB users. The "lib/" folder contains all third-party libraries used in the site to ensure it is fully self-contained with all dependencies. The ["data" folder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv/blob/main/docs/data.md) contains all data derivative outputs, structured following Frictionless Data "Data Package" spec. |
| `docs/` | Contains technical documentation specific to each template. Markdown files in this folder may help provide more technical details if you are doing advanced customization of the template. This is also a good place to put your own project documentation and notes! |
| `objects/` | Contains the digital files used in your collection, see [Collection Objects section]({{ '/docs/objects/' | relative_url }}). |
| `pages/` | Contains the Markdown stubs that will become web pages in your digital collection. Most stubs do not need to be edited as they are controlled by config options. However, users will want to [edit the About or add more interpretive pages]({{ '/docs/pages/' | relative_url }}). |
| `utilities/` | Contains the [sitemap](https://www.sitemaps.org/) and other technical outputs. This folder does not need to be edited by users. |
| `.gitignore` | [Git Ignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) is a file that tells Git to NOT track some files or folders. CB has an ignore that follows a typical Jekyll template. Note that the "objects" directory is ignored by default on CB-CSV projects, since your collection files will be hosted somewhere else. |
| `_config.yml` | The file used to [configure the core features of your CollectionBuilder site]({{ '/docs/config/' | relative_url }}). |
| `favicon.ico` | This icon will display in the browser tab. You can add or create your own to customize your collection site. |
| `Gemfile` | Gemfiles are used to manage Ruby dependencies. CB uses a basic Jekyll Gemfile. |
| `Gemfile.lock` | The Gemfile.lock is generated by your computer to record the exact Ruby Gems used. By default CB ignores the lock for simplicity. However, for more stability you may way to commit your lock to be able to reproduce the exact environment used to build your project. |
| `LICENSE` | This MIT license applies to the CB template code and must be preserved with any CB project. You can add your own license to your content, but the CB template remains MIT. |
| `Rakefile` | Provides automated tasked writing in Ruby. CB templates come with some useful utilities written as [Rake tasks](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv/blob/main/docs/rake_tasks.md). |
| `README.md` | A README describes a project and provides orientation to a repository, and will be displayed on the GitHub home page. If you are starting a CB project, you will want to delete the CB content of the README and describe your own project. |
