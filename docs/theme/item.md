# Item Page 

This section of "theme.yml" lets you add or remove "previous" and "next" buttons to your item pages for use when browsing the collection.

### browse-buttons: 
- Adds previous/next arrows to items, but doubles build time. 
	- *Tip*: We usually add these at the end. They're a nice feature for improved browsing, as they let users use the mouse or the right and left arrow keys to move through the collection. 
	- Options: `true`, `false`
```yaml
browse-buttons: true
```
