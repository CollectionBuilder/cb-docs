# Theme Configuration Options

The "_data/theme.yml" file controls display options for some pages and global options in your final website. 
These variables impact every page the site builds, so you should be sure to go through each one as you create your site.

To start, locate and open the "theme.yml" file in your project repository's "_data" folder.
