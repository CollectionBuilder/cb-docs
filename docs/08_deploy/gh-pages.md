**These instructions are for GH Users**

If you're using one of the other types, CollectionBuilder will not properly build using GitHub Pages due to its inclusion of plugins to build the individual item pages.

**Note**: You will need to make your repository public in order for it to work. You can do this by going to the main Settings page and scrolling to a red box at the bottom. The top option is called "Change repository visibility." Click the Change Visibility button to change your visibility to public. 

# Enabling GitHub Pages

1. In your GitHub account, click on the "Settings" button at the top right of your repository page
2. When you're on the settings page, scroll down to the " Pages" tab that is towards the bottom of the menu on the left and click on it. 
3. You'll be on a new page now. In the **Source** section, change the dropdown button from "none" to "main" (or "master" if that is your default branch) which will cause the page to refresh. 
5. Wait a couple minutes, then refresh the page (or just refresh constantly). The alert will change to green when the site is ready. When it does, click on the URL that appears in the GitHub Pages box to check out your site!!!

#### While you Wait ... Get the Link

6. To make your site's URL easy to access in the future, copy the site URL and go back to your repository's main page. 
7. At the right-hand side of the top of the page, click on the "Edit" button.
8. Add your copied URL to the website section and click "Save" -- This will let you easily access the generated site whenever you come to edit the page.
