# Deploy Your Site

Depending on the version of CollectionBuilder you're using, there are two ways to generate the site: 

- **GH** users will need to turn on the GitHub Pages option via the settings page of their repository on GitHub.com.
- **CDM** and **SA** users will need to use a Jekyll command to [build the site](build/) and then [move those files](move/) to a directory on a web server. 

Both of these approaches are described below. 

{:.alert}
**GH users need only consult the [GH: Enabling GitHub Pages](gh-pages/) section below**. 

{:.alert}
**CDM and SA users should begin with [CDM & SA: Build the Site](build/) and continue on to the next step**.
