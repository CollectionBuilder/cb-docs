# Deploy Your Site

Depending on the version of CollectionBuilder you're using, there are two ways to generate the site: 

- **GH** users will need to turn on the [GitHub Pages]((gh-pages/)) option via the settings page of their repository on GitHub.com.
- **CDM** and **SA** users will need to use a Jekyll command to [build the site](build/) and then [move those files](move/) to a directory on a web server. 

We also provide instructions here on using [third party services](thirdparty/) to serve your site (we often do this to show collaborators how a site is looking) and for deploying Stand Alone or CONTENTdm versions on GitHub Pages using [GitHub actions](actions/).
