# CollectionBuilder Metadata

CollectionBuilder has some metadata standards and formats that you'll need to follow in order for your site to work correctly. 
It can accommodate any metadata field you dream up, but a few fields are required for the tool to work, and others are required if you would like certain visualizations to work. 

We've created metadata templates that contain all the required, visualization-dependent, and recommended fields.
Each CollectionBuilder version has its own template, so be sure to use the table of contents below to navigate to the metadata docs specific to the version you are using.

In many cases you will be transforming existing metadata to populate your new digital collection site -- we've included instructions for this too! 
CollectionBuilder is very flexible with metadata, but you will have to ensure you add the required fields to your existing metadata to get things working.

**Before You Start:** To prevent formatting and encoding errors that can result from using Microsoft Excel, we recommend editing your metadata in Google Sheets. 
If your data will require a good amount of wrangling to get it into CollectionBuilder's format, we suggest you use [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a tool that facilitates data cleaning and transformation.

## Data Dictionary
