# Get a Text Editor

The CollectionBuilder team suggests these open-source, cross platform options for text editors:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (VS Code)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

If you don't have a text editor installed, download one of the above and use their wizard to install with the default options on your computer.

We mostly use Visual Studio Code, so if you don't know which one to pick, go ahead and get that one.

## Configuring Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has a tremendous number of extensions that can be added to enhance its functionality. 
We recommend: 

- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which will check your spelling.
- [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, highlights CSVs to make them easier to read.

VS Code is incredibly customizable via its settings as well. 
To configure the editor, click the *gear icon* in the bottom left corner of the VSCode window and choose *Settings*.
The searchable *Settings* pane has information about all the configuration options.

When you first install VS Code, the default settings can be distracting, so **don't be afraid to turn things off!**

Finally, if you are on Windows, you will want to configure your built in terminal to use Git Bash (rather than Power Shell). 
Open the build in terminal window using Ctrl + backtick (that little character next to the "1" key).
A dropdown is available on the upper left of the terminal pane to switch your terminal.
Set it to use Git Bash as default to ensure you can use Jekyll correctly.
