# Software for Working with CollectionBuilder

{:.alert .alert-blue}
**GH users:** No software needs to be installed to work with CollectionBuilder-GH. 
All actions and edits can be completed via GitHub's website making it easy to get started--you will just need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/). 
However, some GH users might enjoy editing working on their local desktop instead--just follow the instructions below to install the required software--all CB projects use the same environment!

To get started editing code, managing your project, and building websites with CollectionBuilder on your computer you will need: 
a text editor, Git (version control system), Ruby (programming language), and Jekyll (static web site generator). 

Installing software on your computer can be the biggest hurdle to getting started with CollectionBuilder. 
Our advice is to stick with it. Having your local "development environment" for a Jekyll-based project set up will be rewarding, allowing you to edit code and see how the website changes right on your laptop.

***Troubleshooting:*** 
We've tried to anticipate problems you might have in the documentation and the Lib-STATIC [How-To files](https://lib-static.github.io/howto/) we link to. 
If those options fail, try Google using very specific search. 
If Google doesn't help, email [Evan](mailto:ewilliamson@uidaho.edu) (he's probably not doing anything).
