# Ruby on Linux

Ruby can be installed via most distro's repositories or [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/ruby){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. However, it is more up-to-date and best practice to use a version manager such as [RVM](http://rvm.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

- First, ensure you have build tools Make and GCC installed (on Ubuntu get them with `sudo apt install build-essential`).
- Follow the instructions on [RVM install](https://rvm.io/rvm/install){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [rbenv notes](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/ruby-rbenv.html).
