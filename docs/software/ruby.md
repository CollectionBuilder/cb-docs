# Install Ruby

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is a open source programming language popular with web applications.
**_You do not need to know anything about Ruby_** to use CollectionBuilder, but you do need it to run Jekyll on your system!

Jekyll requires a Ruby version 2.4.0 or greater, however, we usually use more up to date Ruby versions. 

Depending on your operating system (i.e. Mac), this might be the most complicated part of the development environment to install, so we divided instructions into three sections:

- [Ruby on Windows]({{ '/docs/software/ruby_windows/' | relative_url }})
- [Ruby on Mac]({{ '/docs/software/ruby_mac/' | relative_url }})
- [Ruby on Linux]({{ '/docs/software/ruby_linux/' | relative_url }})

These approaches that have worked for us, but you may want to refer to Jekyll's official [installation guides](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for more tips!
