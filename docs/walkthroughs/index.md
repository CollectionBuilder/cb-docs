# CollectionBuilder Walkthroughs

The walkthroughs are step-by-step guides designed for beginners interested in using CollectionBuilder. 

Each walkthrough provides concrete, easy-to-follow steps for using a CollectionBuilder Template or completing a related task. The walkthroughs also provide links to additional resources if you are interested in learning more.

We are looking to add more walkthroughs soon! Feel free to post ideas for new walkthroughs and any questions you may have in the [CollectionBuilder Discussion Forum](https://github.com/orgs/CollectionBuilder/discussions).
