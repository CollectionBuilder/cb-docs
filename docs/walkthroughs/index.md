# Walkthroughs

The CollectionBuilder Walkthroughs are step-by-step guides designed for beginners interested in using CollectionBuilder. Each walkthrough provides concrete, easy-to-follow steps for using a CollectionBuilder Template or completing a related task. 

These walkthroughs will also point you to more resources and explanations available in the docs if you are interested in learning more.

If you have any questions as you work through the walkthroughs, feel free to post in the [CollectionBuilder Discussion Forum](https://github.com/orgs/CollectionBuilder/discussions). You can also post ideas for new walkthroughs that might be helpful in the future.
