# Helpful Software

Work on CollectionBuilder projects involves manipulating metadata and digital files.
This page lists some open source tools that might help your workflow when preparing collection contents -- beyond the [software used in building the site]({{ '/docs/software/' | relative_url }}).

--------

## OpenRefine (spreadsheets, data wrangling)

<https://openrefine.org/>

OpenRefine is a free and open source "power tool for working with messy data".
It is great for exploring, cleaning, and transforming data.
If you have extensive work to transform existing metadata or description into something for use in CollectionBuilder, this might be the tool you need!
