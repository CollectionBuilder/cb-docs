# Set up CollectionBuilder Project Repository

To set up a CollectionBuilder project, you'll need a copy of our CollectionBuilder GitHub repository. If you've installed the software, you can pull that copy down to your local computer. If you're using GH with GitHub's online platform, you will make a copy of the repository totally in the browser.
