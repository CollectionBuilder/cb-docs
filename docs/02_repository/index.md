# Set up CollectionBuilder Project Repository

Now that your *development environment* is ready to go, we need to get the code and set up a CollectionBuilder project.

**Note**: As of 2020, all newly-created GitHub repositories will contain a primary branch called **main** instead of **master**. 
Most CollectionBuilder repositories have been migrated to use **main**, however some older repos may still contain a **master** branch. 
We've changed the terminology in our documentation to reflect this, using **main/master** to indicate that you may encounter either of these terms used to describe a repository's primary branch.
