# Create a New Repository

First, set up a repository on GitHub for your CollectionBuilder project.
Each repository on GitHub is basically a folder for storing and tracking the code for a project.

To start your project, you will need a copy of a CollectionBuilder template. 
The best/fastest way to do this is by clicking the green "Use This Template" button. 

1. Login on [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Go to the repository corresponding to the type you are using: 
    - **GH** 
        - <https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh>{:target="_blank"}
    - **CONTENTdm (CDM)** 
        - <https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm>{:target="_blank"} 
    - **SA** 
        - <https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sa>{:target="_blank"} 
3. Click the green "Use This Template" button.    
4. This brings you to a "Create a new repository" page. Follow these steps:
    1. **Enter your new repository name**. Use a lowercase name without spaces or odd characters. We often append `_source` or `_draft` to our projects to keep track of the status. If you are using GH, this name will become part of your site URL, so think through how it will look as a link.
    2. Most users should choose "Public" repository. If you are hosting on GitHub Pages it *must* be public unless you upgrade to a paid account.
    3. Leave the "Include all branches" option **Unchecked**! (you do not want all branches, only the main branch)
    4. Click on the green button "**Create repository from template**." This will take you to your new repository.

*Please Note:*
Using the template is the fastest way to set up a project. 
However, there are alternative, more manual methods to copy the code into your own repository. 
By clicking the "Code" button on the CB repository, you can "Download" the code (meaning you will have a zip file with the complete code) or "Clone" the project (meaning you will have the complete git repository).
Using "fork" should be reserved for situations where you would like to edit the CB template and contribute back to the project via a Pull Request.
