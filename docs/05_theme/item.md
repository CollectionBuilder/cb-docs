# Item Page 

- **browse-buttons**: Adds previous/next arrows to items, but doubles build time. 
	- *Tip*: We usually add these at the end. They're a nice feature for improved browsing, as they let users use the mouse or the right and left arrow keys to move through the collection. 
	- Options: `true`, `false`
	- example --> `browse-buttons: true`
