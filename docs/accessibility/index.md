# Accessibility 

We are informed by the philosophy that accessibility for all people is essential and rooted in the core mission of libraries to provide access to information. 
**Following accessibility guidelines improves usability for everyone.**

CollectionBuilder strives to evaluate and continuously improve structure and markup to positively impact access for all users, on all devices, and to enable preservation for future users.

To do this, we carry out accessibility audits as part of our regular design and development process, using [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/scoring/) and other accessibility and performance audit services to assess our templates in an ongoing manner.
The relative simplicity of CollectionBuilder's static web approach and semantic markup lends itself to accessibility features builtin to HTML and the ability to quickly improve issues.

If you encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to [contact us]({{ '/#how-to-get-in-touch' | relative_url }})!

## Software and Platforms

A variety of platforms and tools are part of the process of creating a CollectionBuilder project.
The accessibility of related platforms impacts users.

## Creating Accessible Collections

The content and metadata you add to CollectionBuilder templates which will impact the accessibility of the resulting website. 
These Docs aim to provide tips for creators in each relevant section to help make informed choices. 
We also hope to create tutorials for auditing your own site and share further resources.
