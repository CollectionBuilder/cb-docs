# CollectionBuilder Templates

This Documentation applies to all the current "Templates" of the CollectionBuilder tool. 
For the majority of each template's features and setups the documentation is the same. 
There are steps where the documentation does vary between templates, however, so be on the lookout for bolded font and colored alerts that indicate when the documentation diverges. 

The templates are currently: 

- **GH** - for [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh), a lightweight learning-focused template designed for free hosting on GitHub Pages.
- **CSV** - for [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv), a robust template for developing exhibits on your local computer (and serving them from anywhere!)
- **CDM** - for [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm), a template for generating a "skin" over an existing CONTENTdm repository - this is a *legacy* template, in general it will be better to use CB-CSV for starting new projects!
