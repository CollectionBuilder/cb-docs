# Deploy Your Site

Depending on the version of CollectionBuilder you're using and where you would like to host the site, there are a few ways to generate and deploy your digital collection site: 

- Deploy using the free [GitHub Pages]({{ '/docs/deploy/gh-pages/' | relative_url }}) service -- this is how most **GH** and **Sheets** users deploy their sites.
- [Build the site with Jekyll]({{ '/docs/deploy/build/' | relative_url }}), then move the files to a web server -- this allows for the publishing of CollectionBuilder sites on your own or your organizations web servers. 
- [Enable GitHub Pages publishing via GitHub Actions](({{ '/docs/deploy/actions/' | relative_url }})--these features now make publishing  **CDM** and **CSV** sites freely on GitHub a fairly easy possibility
- [Use Third-Party Build Services]({{ '/docs/deploy/thirdparty/' | relative_url }}) documented in this section that provide other flexible deployment solutions.
