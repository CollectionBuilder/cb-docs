# Deploy Your Site

Depending on the version of CollectionBuilder you're using and where you would like to host the site, there are a few ways to generate and deploy your digital collection site: 

- Most **GH** users: deploy using the free [GitHub Pages]({{ '/docs/deploy/gh-pages/' | relative_url }}) service.
- Most **CDM** and **SA** users: [build the site with Jekyll]({{ '/docs/deploy/build/' | relative_url }}), then [move the files]({{ '/docs/deploy/move/' | relative_url }}) to a web server. 

Alternatively, explore options such as [GitHub Actions]({{ '/docs/deploy/actions/' | relative_url }}) and [Third party build services]({{ '/docs/deploy/thirdparty/' | relative_url }}) documented in this section.
