# Moving the _site Files to Your Web Server

Once you've completed the build process, the web files you need will all be in your `_site` directory. 

1. Open the `_site` directory using your file explorer or finder.
2. Copy everything you'd like to move into a production site (typically, this means everything in the folder).
3. Paste the copied files and folders into the directory on your web server you'd like to serve this site from. 

*Note: If you'd like to serve this up from a GitHub Pages enabled repository, that is also possible. Talk to us.*

That's it. You've Done It. And hopefully now you can do it again (and again and again), and after awhile, teach others this development model and/or tool as well. Please let us know if we can help! ([Evan](mailto:ewilliamson@uidaho.edu) has time, I'm sure.)
