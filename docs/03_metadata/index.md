# CollectionBuilder Metadata

CollectionBuilder has some metadata standards and formats that you'll need to follow in order for your site to work correctly. 
In many cases you will be transforming existing metadata to populate your new digital collection site: luckily CollectionBuilder is very flexible with metadata, but you will have to ensure you add the required fields to get things working. 
The different CollectionBuilder types have a few differences so be sure to check the docs specific to the template you are using.

**Before You Start:** To prevent formatting and encoding errors that can result from using Microsoft Excel, we recommend editing your metadata in Google Sheets. If your data will require a good amount of wrangling to get it into CollectionBuilder's format, we suggest you use [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/), a tool that facilitates data cleaning and transformation."

For a more detailed description of how each format is defined and mapped, see the [CollectionBuilder Data Dictionary](/images/data_dictionary.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
