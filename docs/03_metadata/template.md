**Before You Start:** To prevent formatting and encoding errors that can result from using Microsoft Excel, we recommend editing your metadata in Google Sheets. If your data will require a good amount of wrangling to get it into CollectionBuilder's format, we suggest you use [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/), a platform that facilitates large scale data cleaning and transformation."

# Metadata Template

CollectionBuilder can accomodate any metadata field you dream up.  

A few fields, nevertheless, are required for the tool to work, and others are required if you would like certain visualizations to work. We've created metadata templates that contain all the required, visualization-dependent, and recommended fields. 

If you'd like a model for your metadata, take a look at your type's metadata template by clicking on the appropriate button. The templates are contained in Google Sheets for easy re-use (just "Make a Copy" via the File menu to get started).
