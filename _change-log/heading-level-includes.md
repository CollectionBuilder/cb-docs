title: Heading Level Option for Includes
release: 2024-12-04
---

All index and feature includes now have a `heading_level` option (when relevant) to customize the level of the heading if necessary for accessibility.
This allows users to better ensure consistent heading use on pages without skipping levels.
Check the comments at the top of each include for details!
