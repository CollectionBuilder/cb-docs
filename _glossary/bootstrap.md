Described as "the worldâ€™s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites", Bootstrap is a package of CSS and JS that provides grid, layout, and UI components that can be used to quickly build and style a responsive website.

CollectionBuilder currently uses **version 4.6** as a base.
This allows you to use Bootstrap columns, components, and utilities to customize your pages.
