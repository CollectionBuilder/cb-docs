# CollectionBuilder Docs

Everything you ever wanted to know about how to use CollectionBuilder!

## Introduction

CollectionBuilder was built for a wide variety of users, so we've tried to make the tool as easy to use as possible. 
Some initial set-up is required, especially for our Skin and Stand-Alone versions, as these require the installation of Ruby and Jekyll on a personal computer. 

Once the initial set-up is complete, users will be able to create their collections through adjustments to metadata and to config files. 

### Types

This Documentation applies to all the current "Types" of the CollectionBuilder tool. 
For the majority of the tool's features and setups, the documentation is the same. 
There are steps where the documentation does vary between types, however, so be on the lookout for bolded font and colored alerts that indicate when the documentation diverges. 

The types are currently: 

- **GH** - for [CollectionBuilder-GH](/gh/), our lightweight, GitHub Pages version.

- **CDM** - for [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](/skins/), a skin version that works with the CONTENTdm API.

- **SA** - for [CollectionBuilder-Stand-Alone](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/sa/), our robust, stand-alone version for developing your own exhibits on your local computer (and serving them from anywhere!).
