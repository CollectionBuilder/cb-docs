# CollectionBuilder Docs

Everything you ever wanted to know about how to use CollectionBuilder-GH, CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm, and CollectionBuilder-SA!

## Introduction

CollectionBuilder was designed with learning in mind. The project's workflow is scaffolded in order to help users  build web and data literacy skills as they progress towards building and deploying new digital exhibits. To that end, we've worked hard to make this documentation comprehensible for the novice user moving through the sections step-by step and useful for more advanced users searching for specific content.

## Types

This Documentation applies to all the current "Types" of the CollectionBuilder tool. 
For the majority of the tool's features and setups, the documentation is the same. 
There are steps where the documentation does vary between types, however, so be on the lookout for bolded font and colored alerts that indicate when the documentation diverges. 

The types are currently: 

- **GH** - for [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh), a lightweight learning-focused template designed for free hosting on GitHub Pages.
- **CDM** - for [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm), a template for generating a "skin" over an existing CONTENTdm repository.
- **SA** - for [CollectionBuilder-StandAlone](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sa), a robust, stand-alone template for developing exhibits on your local computer (and serving them from anywhere!).
