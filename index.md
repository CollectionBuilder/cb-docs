# CollectionBuilder Docs

CollectionBuilder was designed with learning in mind--and so are these docs!

CollectionBuilder's workflow is scaffolded in order to help users build web and data literacy skills as they progress towards building and deploying new digital exhibits. 
To that end, we've worked hard to make this documentation comprehensible for the novice user moving through the sections step by step, as well as, useful for more advanced users searching for specific content.

We hope you will find everything needed to create a CollectionBuilder project--but also learn the techniques of a static web approach that can power many other types of projects!
And if you run into issues or have questions don't hesitate to ask!

## Templates

This Documentation applies to all the current "Templates" of the CollectionBuilder tool. 
For the majority of the tool's features and setups, the documentation is the same. 
There are steps where the documentation does vary between templates, however, so be on the lookout for bolded font and colored alerts that indicate when the documentation diverges. 

The templates are currently: 

- **GH** - for [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh), a lightweight learning-focused template designed for free hosting on GitHub Pages.
- **CSV** - for [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv), a robust template for developing exhibits on your local computer (and serving them from anywhere!)
- **CDM** - for [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm), a template for generating a "skin" over an existing CONTENTdm repository - this is a *legacy* template, in general it will be better to use CB-CSV for starting new projects!
